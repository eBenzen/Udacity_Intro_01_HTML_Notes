        <h3>Lesson 1 - Welcome to Nanodegree</h3>

          Here we go!<br/>
          <br/>

          <b>Debugging</b><br/>
          1. Collect evidence (what makes this program fail?)<br/>
          2. Generate theories (what may have caused this problem?)<br/>
          3. Test those theories (if my theory is correct, how could I find out?)<br/>
          4. Fix the problem<br/>
          <br/>

          <em>Neat part on the fact that they are not your teachers, but rather you ultimately are always in control of the EDU.  So in other words, do not judge and education program by how successful the teachers are at the material, but rather how they can equip you to learn master the subject yourself.</em><br/>

          <br/>

        <h3>Lesson 3 - The World Wide Web</h3>

          <b>What is the www anyway?</b><br/>
            <div style="color:#FF0000">
              1. You interact with browser<br/>
              2. Who interacts with the internet<br/>
              3. Who speaks with the servers<br/>
              4. Speaking HTTP<br/>
            </div>
            <br/>


        <h3>Lesson 4 - HTML Basics</h3>

          <p>
            <b>How to HTML</b><br/>
            1. Look up how to use the tag<br/>
            2. Use it<br/>
            3. Forget it<br/>
            4. Find it again on <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3Schools</a><br/>
            <br/>
          </p>

          <p>
            Such as using the tag "span" to color an inline text <span style="color:blue">blue</span>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Or how I used the "div" tag to make the above section <span style="color:#FF0000">red</span>.
          </p>
